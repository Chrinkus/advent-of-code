# Goals and Practices

This year I'm going for 50/50 stars DURING the competition. Last year I had hoped to "try" doing some of the challenges in C, this year we're doing the whole thing in it!

## Guiding Principles

- Write in C99
- Stream all inputs into executables
	- No hard-coding sizes, ranges or other info that would only be known by inspecting the input data
- Stick to the [Linux Kernel coding style](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/v4.10/process/coding-style.html)
	- Pretty much KnR with 8-character Tabs (actual tabs)
	- Don't be scared to hang a few massive `switch`'s off un-bracketed `for`'s though..'
- Pretty up the output a bit!
- Utilize my other big C-project [libsxc](https://github.com/Chrinkus/libsxc) for dynamic containers and such.
	- Hopefully being a consumer of my library will make me better at writing it!
- Resist the urge to play 'golf'.
	- Try to write good code, not clever code.
	- I mean, try..

## Things to Learn

- Reading inputs
	- This was the biggest hurdle back in 2017 with C++ and what stalled my attempts to use C last year.
	- scanf, fgetc and...
- PCRE! But only when I must.
- Path finding.
- 2 dimensional arrays.
	- NOT non-contiguous lists of 1D arrays.
- Standard library
	- Everyone seems to use `memset` and `memmove`. Why?
- Bitwise operators
