# Advent of Code 2021

_Ack! It's November 30th and I haven't set this up yet!_

The goal this year is to solve the whole thing in C. I had intended to do this last year but bailed almost immediately when I needed a data structure. This year I'm stronger in C and have a few things prepared in a personal library.

Let's go!
