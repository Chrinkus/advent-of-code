# AoC 2023 - C Journal

Each day of the challenge I will comment on the puzzle in some way. I have started the challenge late this year as I've kind of been off coding and had some issues with 2FA on my GitHub account. I'm about 4 days behind so let's go!!

## Day 1 - Trebuchet?!

Shooting into the sky to fix the global snow shortage. Sounds about right.

This was a little more challenging than a typical day 1 problem. String processing with multiple layers of conditionals. I went with a fixed buffer which feels DIRTY but hey, its day one, right?

Detecting digits is pretty straight forward but then parsing words for numbers gave me a chance to use one of my favourite dictionary patterns from Modern C.

The answers for parts 1 and 2 were close enough to make me doubt the solution but it was successful. On to day 2!
