# Advent of Code

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com) challenges by [Eric Wastl](https://github.com/topaz). After initially creating a new repository every year I've collected all of my work into this one repo.

## Summary of Events

### 2017

My first AoC. At the time I was working through Bjarne Stroustrup's Programming Principles and Practice using C++. I was much stronger in JavaScript so I planned to do as many exercises as possible in C++ then swap over when it got "tough". I was able to finish the event in C++(!) but not without a few late nights and sneaking in stars on breaks at work.

The code is pretty cringe-y but it has been preserved here for your viewing pleasure.

### 2018

After completing the previous year I was very excited for the 2018 event to start. This time I was armed with a stronger grasp of C++ and an official AoC coffee mug. I struggled mightily to maintain a better AoC/work/life balance. In the end I got absolutely wrecked by a weighted path-finding problem and a 3D space collision problem.

Did not complete.
