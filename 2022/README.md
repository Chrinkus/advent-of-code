# Advent of Code 2022

Another year, another wonderful event! This year I will be solving problems in C and Rust at the start. A significant change over previous years is that I will not be attempting the solutions as they release. Rather I will be valuing my sleep and attempting the problems the following day on my lunch break.

Something else I'd like to do is keep a running journal of my thought process each day. Returning to problems in previous years I have found that my current thinking is different at some points and I would like to have a more literal record of my process than just the code.
